# Color_Detection
Colour Detection is the process of detecting the name of any color. Well, for humans this is an extremely task but for computers, it is not straight forward. Human eyes and brains work together to translate light into color. Light receptors that are present in our eyes transmit the signal to the brain. Our brain then recognizes the color. Since childhood, we have mapped certain lights with their color names. We will be using the somewhat same strategy to detect color names.
